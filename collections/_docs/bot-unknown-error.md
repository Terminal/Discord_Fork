# UNKNOWN_ERROR when inviting Bots
When inviting a bot, you may encounter the following screen:

![An image of the UNKNOWN_ERROR screen](/assets/images/invite/unknown_error.png)

This can mean one of many things:

- The user who published the bot has made a mistake
- The user who published the bot has deleted the bot

In these scenarios, it is unlikely that you will be able to invite the bot.
[Please find us on Discord]({{ site.data.links.discord }}) and tell us about where you found the error.
