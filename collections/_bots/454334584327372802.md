# Supporto
Supporto is a simple Ticket-bot, with a small twist.  
Instead of you having to type something like `/new <topic>` to create a ticket, Supporto simply lets you set a channel as a ticket-channel, where people can just type a message and the bot will make a new ticket.  
The creator, people with the permission `manage server` or a set staff-role can then close the ticket, by simply clicking on the reaction of the first message and confirming the close.

Every participient in the ticket will receive a transcript of the chat in a DM.

##NOTES
People with `manage server` permission or a registered staff-role assigned **Can NOT** create a ticket like normal.  
This was made to let people have a way, to make a message in their ticket-channel (e.g. for information).  
If you still want to create a ticket, add a `-test` to the message.
